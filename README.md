## Description

This repository holds the code for the Hack & Craft Smart Sign project.

WiFi information has been removed for security and would need to be added for any future code to work.

## Uploading code

You're welcome to upload new code to the boards using USB or OTA.

Make sure to turn off the power and disconnect the board from the LED strip before plugging in USB.

Also note that after any code has been uploaded since delivery by SmashLabs, that we'll be unable to support the sign under the terms of the original order. But can assist with debugging and other code changes as part of a new project.
